# discordbot
Built a Discord bot that plays music in voice channels, allowing users to request songs by name. The bot searches both Spotify and YouTube APIs to find and stream songs. Over 25 users used my bot across various Discord servers.
The bot is developed using Node.js, leveraging libraries like discord.js, @discordjs/voice, and ytdl-core for handling Discord events, voice channel interactions, and YouTube audio streaming. On average, it processes 35 - 40 song requests daily.
Established a comprehensive framework for handling API authentication and error management for Spotify and YouTube Data APIs, resulting close to 50% reduction in troubleshooting time and increasing development efficiency.
